Whether working on personal passion projects or professional systems, I love transforming ideas into high-performance solutions, from developing APIs and optimising cloud infrastructure to building intuitive interfaces.

Constantly learning: Sharpening my skills on Clouds and AI at the moment. ðŸŽ“
