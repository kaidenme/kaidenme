### About Me

I’m a full-stack developer with nearly 2 years of experience building scalable, cloud-powered web applications. I specialize in the Microsoft stack for backend development and modern JavaScript frameworks on the frontend, with AWS powering cloud infrastructure. I work across the full development cycle—from designing APIs and optimizing deployments to creating responsive, user-friendly interfaces.

Constantly learning: Sharpening my skills on Clouds and AI at the moment. �
